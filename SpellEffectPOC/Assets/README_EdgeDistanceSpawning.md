# Edge Distance Validation for Spawning Systems

## Overview

Both the Enemy Spawn System and Collectible Spawn System now include **edge distance validation** to prevent objects from spawning too close to NavMesh boundaries (walls, obstacles, etc.). This solves the visibility issue where spawned objects could appear behind walls or become partially hidden.

## How It Works

### Edge Detection Process
1. **Find NavMesh Position**: System finds a valid position on the NavMesh
2. **Check Edge Distance**: Uses `NavMesh.FindClosestEdge()` to find the nearest boundary
3. **Validate Distance**: Ensures the distance to the edge is greater than the configured minimum
4. **Retry if Too Close**: If too close to an edge, tries a different position

### Technical Implementation
```csharp
// Check distance from NavMesh edges (walls/obstacles)
NavMeshHit edgeHit;
if (NavMesh.FindClosestEdge(navMeshPosition, out edgeHit, NavMesh.AllAreas))
{
    float distanceFromEdge = Vector3.Distance(navMeshPosition, edgeHit.position);
    if (distanceFromEdge < minDistanceFromEdge)
    {
        continue; // Too close to edge, try again
    }
}
```

## Configuration Settings

### Enemy Spawner
- **Parameter**: `Min Distance From Edge`
- **Default Value**: `3.0` meters
- **Recommended Range**: `2.0 - 5.0` meters
- **Purpose**: Ensures enemies spawn with enough clearance from walls

### Collectible Spawner
- **Parameter**: `Min Distance From Edge`  
- **Default Value**: `2.0` meters
- **Recommended Range**: `1.0 - 3.0` meters
- **Purpose**: Prevents collectibles from being hidden behind walls
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Feature is fully functional

## Benefits

### ✅ **Improved Visibility**
- No more enemies/collectibles spawning behind walls
- Objects are always clearly visible to the player
- Better gameplay experience with obvious targets

### ✅ **Better Accessibility**
- Collectibles are always reachable by the player
- Enemies can properly engage with the player
- No "stuck" objects in inaccessible areas

### ✅ **Professional Polish**
- Eliminates visual glitches and frustration
- Creates more predictable spawning behavior
- Enhances overall game quality

## Configuration Guidelines

### For Different Enemy Types

#### **Large Enemies (Trolls, Giants)**
```
Min Distance From Edge: 4.0 - 5.0 meters
Reason: Need more space for their larger collision volumes
```

#### **Medium Enemies (Basilisk, Dementor)**
```
Min Distance From Edge: 3.0 - 4.0 meters  
Reason: Standard clearance for most enemies
```

#### **Small Enemies**
```
Min Distance From Edge: 2.0 - 3.0 meters
Reason: Minimal clearance while still ensuring visibility
```

### For Different Collectible Types

#### **Large Collectibles (Golden Eggs)**
```
Min Distance From Edge: 2.0 - 3.0 meters
Reason: Larger objects need more clearance
```

#### **Small Collectibles (Chocolate Frogs)**
```
Min Distance From Edge: 1.5 - 2.5 meters
Reason: Smaller objects can be closer to walls while remaining visible
```

## Inspector Settings

### Enemy Spawner Configuration
1. Open the **EnemySpawner** GameObject in your scene
2. In the **Spawn Area Configuration** section:
   - Set **Min Distance From Edge**: `3.0` (recommended)
3. Test and adjust based on your level geometry

### Collectible Spawner Configuration  
1. Open the **CollectibleSpawner** GameObject in your scene
2. In the **Spawn Configuration** section:
   - Set **Min Distance From Edge**: `2.0` (recommended)
3. Test and adjust based on your level geometry

## Debugging and Testing

### Debug Information
Both systems now log edge distance checks:
```
[EnemySpawner] Position too close to edge: 1.2m < 3.0m (attempt 5)
[CollectibleSpawner] Found valid spawn position: (25.3, 0.1, -18.7) (attempt 3)
```

### Visual Debugging
- Use the **Scene View** to observe spawn attempts
- Check the **Console** for edge distance warnings
- Adjust settings based on observed behavior

### Testing Process
1. **Start the game** with debug logging enabled
2. **Monitor spawning** for several cycles
3. **Look for edge warnings** in the console
4. **Adjust distance values** if too many failures occur
5. **Verify visibility** of all spawned objects

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Failed Spawn Attempts
**Problem**: Objects failing to spawn due to edge distance requirements
**Solutions**:
- Reduce `Min Distance From Edge` value
- Increase `Max Spawn Attempts` 
- Expand the `Spawn Radius`
- Check that your NavMesh has sufficient open areas

### Objects Still Too Close to Walls
**Problem**: Objects spawning near walls despite edge distance settings
**Solutions**:
- Increase `Min Distance From Edge` value
- Verify NavMesh boundaries are properly baked
- Check for complex geometry that may confuse edge detection

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Too many spawn attempts causing frame drops
**Solutions**:
- Reduce `Max Spawn Attempts` 
- Optimize NavMesh complexity
- Consider caching valid spawn positions

## Technical Notes

### NavMesh Requirements
- Ensure your NavMesh is properly baked
- Complex geometry may require higher edge distance values
- Edge detection works with all NavMesh areas

### Performance Considerations
- Edge distance checking adds minimal overhead
- Each attempt requires one `NavMesh.FindClosestEdge()` call
- Failed attempts are logged for debugging

### Compatibility
- Works with existing NavMesh setups
- Compatible with all enemy and collectible types
- No breaking changes to existing configurations

## Best Practices

1. **Start with recommended values** (3m for enemies, 2m for collectibles)
2. **Test in your specific level** geometry
3. **Monitor debug logs** during testing
4. **Adjust gradually** based on observed behavior
5. **Balance visibility vs spawn success rate**

This edge distance validation ensures a professional, polished spawning experience where all objects are clearly visible and accessible to players!
