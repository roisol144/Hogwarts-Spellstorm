   - Recommended fonts:
     * "Harry P" by Phoenix Phonts (most popular)
     * "Magic School" by FontMesa
     * "Magical Me" (Parry Hotter style)
     * "Lumos" (chapter title style)

2. INSTALL THE FONT:
   - Download the .ttf or .otf file
   - Place it in this folder: Assets/Resources/Fonts/
   - Import it into Unity

3. CREATE TEXTMESHPRO FONT ASSET:

   - Select: Create → TextMeshPro → Font Asset
   - Name the asset one of these exact names:
     * HarryPotter
     * MagicalFont  
     * WizardFont
   - The MagicalDebugUI script will automatically find it

4. ALTERNATIVE FREE FONTS:
