# Spells Book Positioning Fix

## üéØ **Problem Fixed**
The spells book popup was appearing where the player was looking instead of staying in its designed Canvas position in the center.

## üîß **What Was Happening**
The `ShowSpellsBookPopup()` method was calling `PositionSpellsBookInFrontOfPlayer()` which moved the spells book to appear in front of the player's camera, overriding its natural Canvas positioning.

## ‚úÖ **What I Fixed**

### **1. Removed Camera Positioning from ShowSpellsBookPopup()**
```csharp
// OLD CODE (problematic):
PositionSpellsBookInFrontOfPlayer(spellsBookPopup); // This moved the spells book!

// NEW CODE (fixed):
// Note: Removed automatic positioning - spells book should stay in its Canvas position
```

### **2. Removed Camera Positioning from SetActivePanel()**
```csharp
// OLD CODE (problematic):
if (activePanel == spellsBookPopup)
{
    PositionSpellsBookInFrontOfPlayer(activePanel); // This also moved the spells book!
}

// NEW CODE (fixed):
// Note: Removed automatic positioning for all menu panels and popups
// All UI elements should stay in their designed Canvas positions
```

## üéÆ **Result**
Now all menu elements behave consistently:
- ‚úÖ **Main Menu**: Stays centered as designed
- ‚úÖ **Map Selection**: Stays in Canvas position
- ‚úÖ **Level Selection**: Stays in Canvas position
- ‚úÖ **Player Name Input**: Stays in Canvas position
- ‚úÖ **Spells Book**: Stays in Canvas position (FIXED!)

## üîÑ **Complete Menu Positioning System**

All menu panels and popups now:
1. **Stay in their designed Canvas positions**
2. **Appear consistently in the center**
3. **Don't follow the player's camera**
4. **Maintain proper UI layout**

## üìÅ **Files Modified**
- `MainMenuManager.cs` - Removed camera positioning calls

**The spells book will now appear in the center like all other menu elements!** üìñ‚ú®
