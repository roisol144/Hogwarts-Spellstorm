# ✅ CLEAN FILE-BASED SCOREBOARD SOLUTION

## 🎯 **EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED FOR!**

Your **existing scoreboard in the scene** now reads from a simple JSON file. No mess, no complex debug stuff - just clean file-based storage.

---

## 📄 **SIMPLE FILE SYSTEM:**

### **File Location:**
- **Path**: `persistentDataPath/hogwarts_scores.json`
- **Format**: Simple JSON with player names and scores
- **Behavior**: Creates automatically when needed, uses existing file if present

### **How It Works:**
1. **Game Scene**: `SimplestScoreSaver` saves scores to file when you win/die
2. **Main Menu**: Your existing `WorkingScoreboard` reads from file and displays scores
3. **File**: Persistent JSON storage that survives game restarts

---

## 🚀 **SETUP (1 Minute):**

1. **Go to your game scene** (where you play and win)
2. `Tools → 📄 Simple File Scoreboard Setup`

### **Step 2: Test It**
