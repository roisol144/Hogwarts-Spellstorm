# 🎯 SOLUTION: Name Not Appearing in Scoreboard

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
You entered your name and played the game, but when you returned to main menu, your name wasn't in the scoreboard.

### **Root Cause:**
- ✅ **Player name input works** (gets saved to PlayerPrefs)
- ✅ **Scoreboard display works** (shows sample data)
- ❌ **Missing connection** between game completion and scoreboard saving

**The game isn't automatically saving your score when you win/lose!**

---

## ✅ **COMPLETE SOLUTION PROVIDED:**

### **New Component: AutoScoreboardConnector**
I've created a component that automatically connects your game completion events to the scoreboard system.

### **What It Does:**
1. **Listens for game victory events** from GameLevelManager
2. **Gets your player name** from PlayerPrefs (set in main menu)
3. **Calculates final score** based on game results
4. **Saves to scoreboard** automatically using WorkingScoreboard.AddPlayerScore()
5. **Also saves to GameScoreManager** if available

## 🚀 **EASY SETUP (2 Minutes):**

### **Step 1: Add to Your Game Scenes**
1. **Open your game scene** (DungeonsScene, ChamberOfSecretsScene, etc.)
2. `Tools → 🔗 Connect Game to Scoreboard`
3. Click **"🔗 ADD SCOREBOARD CONNECTION"**
4. **Done!** The connector is now in your scene

### **Step 2: Test It**
1. **Save the scene**
2. **Go to main menu** 
3. **Enter your name** and start a game
4. **Complete/win the game**
5. **Return to main menu**
6. **Check scoreboard** → Your name should be there!

## 🔧 **WHAT GETS CONNECTED:**

### **Game Victory Detection:**
```csharp
// Connects to existing GameLevelManager victory event
gameLevelManager.OnVictoryAchieved.AddListener(OnGameVictory);
```

### **Automatic Score Saving:**
```csharp
// When you win, this runs automatically:
WorkingScoreboard.AddPlayerScore(playerName, finalScore, mapName, difficulty);
```

### **Player Data Source:**
- **Name**: From PlayerPrefs (set when you enter name in main menu)
- **Score**: From game completion event (your actual game score)
- **Map**: Current scene name (DungeonsScene, etc.)
- **Difficulty**: From PlayerPrefs (set when you select difficulty)
