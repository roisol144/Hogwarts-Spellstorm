# ✅ FIXED: Win AND Loss Score Tracking

## 🔍 **ISSUES FIXED:**

### **1. Compilation Error:**
- ❌ **Error**: `OnVictoryAchieved cannot be accessed with an instance reference`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Changed to static event access: `GameLevelManager.OnVictoryAchieved += OnGameVictory`

### **2. Missing Loss/Death Scores:**
- ❌ **Problem**: Only victory scores were saved, not death scores
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added `PlayerHealth.OnPlayerDied` event connection
- ✅ **Result**: Now saves scores for BOTH wins AND losses!

---

## 🎯 **COMPLETE SCORE TRACKING:**

### **Victory Scores:**
```csharp
GameLevelManager.OnVictoryAchieved += OnGameVictory;
// Saves full victory score when you win
```

### **Death Scores:**
```csharp
playerHealth.OnPlayerDied.AddListener(OnPlayerDeath);
// Saves participation score when you die
```

### **Score Calculation for Deaths:**
- **Base score**: 100 points (for participation)
- **Difficulty bonus**: 50-150 points based on difficulty
- **Progress bonus**: Half of your current in-game score
- **Example**: Die with 200 points on Intermediate = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 total
