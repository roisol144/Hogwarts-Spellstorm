# Magical Debug UI Setup Guide

## Overview
The Magical Debug UI system replaces the old static spell cast text with a dynamic, camera-relative UI that always appears in the bottom left corner of the player's view. This creates a more immersive experience for VR/XR applications.

## Features
- âœ¨ **Camera-Relative Positioning**: Text always stays in the bottom left corner regardless of head movement
- ðŸŽ¨ **Magical Font Support**: Automatically loads Harry Potter style fonts when available
- ðŸŒŸ **Color Animation**: Text animates with magical colors when spells are cast
- ðŸŽ¯ **XR Rig Integration**: Properly parents to XR Rig or Camera for VR compatibility
- ðŸ”§ **Easy Setup**: Automatic configuration and fallback systems

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
1. Add the `MagicalDebugUI` component to any GameObject in your scene
2. The script will automatically:
   - Find your XR Rig or Main Camera
   - Create a world-space canvas
   - Configure the spell text with magical styling
   - Position everything in the bottom left corner

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Create a GameObject called "MagicalDebugUI"
2. Add the `MagicalDebugUI` component
3. Optionally assign references in the inspector:
   - **Debug Canvas**: The canvas for the UI (will be created if not assigned)
   - **Spell Text**: The TextMeshPro component (will be created if not assigned)
   - **Player Camera**: Your main camera (auto-detected if not assigned)
   - **XR Rig**: Your XR Rig transform (auto-detected if not assigned)

## Font Setup
To use Harry Potter style fonts:

1. Download a Harry Potter font (like "Harry P" from FontSpace)
2. Import the .ttf file into `Assets/Resources/Fonts/`
3. Create a TextMeshPro Font Asset:
   - Right-click on the font â†’ Create â†’ TextMeshPro â†’ Font Asset
   - Name it "HarryPotter", "MagicalFont", or "WizardFont"
   - Place it in `Assets/Resources/Fonts/`

The system will automatically load the first available font with these names.

## Configuration

### Positioning
Adjust the positioning by modifying these values in the inspector:
- **Offset**: Position relative to camera (x: left/right, y: up/down, z: forward/back)
- **Canvas Size**: Size of the UI canvas in world units

### Text Appearance
The text automatically uses:
- Golden color (#FFCC00) as the base
- Magical blue (#80E5FF) for animations
- Size 24 font with word wrapping enabled
- Left alignment for better readability

## Integration

### With Existing SpellCastingManager
The system is already integrated! The SpellCastingManager now calls:
```csharp
MagicalDebugUI.NotifySpellCast(spellName);
```

### With Custom Scripts
To trigger the magical UI from your own scripts:
```csharp
MagicalDebugUI.NotifySpellCast("Your Spell Name");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Text Not Visible
- Check that the MagicalDebugUI component is active
- Verify the camera reference is correct
- Ensure the offset values place the UI in front of the camera
- Check console for any error messages

### Font Not Loading
- Ensure the font file is in `Assets/Resources/Fonts/`
- Check that the font asset is named correctly
- Verify the font asset was created properly for TextMeshPro

### Position Issues in VR
- Make sure the XR Rig reference is set correctly
- Check that the canvas is set to World Space render mode
- Adjust the offset values for your specific VR setup

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Positioning
Override the `UpdateUIPosition()` method to implement custom positioning logic.

### Custom Animations
Modify the `AnimateSpellText()` coroutine to create your own magical effects.

### Multiple UI Elements
Create multiple instances of the MagicalDebugUI for different types of information.

## Dependencies
- TextMeshPro (included with Unity)
- Unity XR packages (for VR/AR functionality)
- Unity.XR.CoreUtils (for XR Origin detection)

## Notes
- The old `spellCastText` field in SpellCastingManager is kept for backward compatibility but is no longer used by default
- The system gracefully fallbacks if XR components are not available
- All positioning is relative to ensure it works across different VR headsets and orientations
